# How-to-make-Flip-flop-Circuit
In this project circuit, we will teach you making a good quality flip-flop circuit. A flip flop is an electronic circuit with tow stable states that can be used to store binary data. Then stored data can be changed by applying varying inputs. Flip-flops and latches are used as data storage elements. This is a bitable circuit concept in which it has two stable stages either On or OFF. It is kind of circuit that changes back and forth between two states (on and off) at certain intervals. Flip-flops maintain their state indefinitely until an input pulse called a trigger is received. It flips into one state, than flops to another and so on.
